# medical-imaging-journey
A personal journal to track my learning progress in medical imaging, Python programming, and signal processing as a medical engineering student.

## ✅ Completed Course: Python for Medical Imaging for Beginners  
**Instructor**: Dr. Joan S Muthu  
**Platform**: Udemy  
**Completed**: July 22, 2025

### 🧠 What I Learned

#### 🖼️ Medical Imaging Concepts
- Overview of medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, Ultrasound, etc.)
- Common file types: BMP, PNG, JPEG, NIfTI, TIFF, DICOM, STL
- Strengths and use-cases of each image format

#### 🐍 Python Libraries & Tools
- `matplotlib` – for basic image visualization
- `OpenCV (cv2)` – for reading, writing, manipulating images
- `ImageIO` – to handle a variety of formats
- `Pillow` – for basic image operations like resize and save
- `pydicom` – for reading and exploring DICOM metadata/images
- `nibabel` – for working with NIfTI medical imaging files
- `tifffile` – TIFF format support
- `vedo` – for 3D STL file visualization

#### 🛠️ Practical Skills Gained
- Open, read, and display medical images using Python
- Save images to different formats
- Apply basic image processing: contrast, brightness, smoothing, sharpening
- Perform basic image transformations (e.g., flip, rotate, resize)
- Understand DICOM metadata and image structure

### 🧩 Reflection
This course introduced me to the fundamental image formats used in the medical field and how to manipulate them using Python. I now have hands-on experience reading and writing different types of medical images, which has deepened my interest in medical image analysis and AI.
